2. **Formalization of Plane Trees**
3. **Formalization of Full Binary Trees**
4. **Enumeration of Full Binary Trees with `n` Nodes**
5. **Generation of Ballot Sequences of Length `n`**

### Large Tasks
1. **Bijection between List Plane Trees and Plane Trees**
2. **Rotation Isomorphism in Trees**
3. **Proof that $\binom{2n}{n}$ is Divisible by $n+1$ (partial proof)**
4. **Proof that $C_n = \frac{\binom{2n}{n}}{n+1}$**
